to edit the interact html,
1. download repository to a file on your computer
2. open command prompt
3. use associated commands to become present in the file set of interest
4. after downloading jupyter through anaconda, you can open the file within jupyter notebooks with the command "jupyter notebook"
5. save the python file on the notebook, which will save the file to your computer
6. to create the interactive html, after having downloaded the interact package as well the one done by two Berkeley PhD's, 
which you can find online, which you can find documentation here: https://www.nbinteract.com/   it becomes possible to create the html 
of the ipynb file, see the website documentation for an easy specific code sequence to do so.
7. git push and git commit the new files to sync the repository with your computer's now updated file set
8. the html format/url can be found on the nbinteract website, and wallah an interactive html. 
9. hope y'all can find a way to possibly incorporate the interactive python ability into an html
10. though it took two phd's years to figure out themselves, the way to have an html actively be updating, best of your ability
